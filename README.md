# Machine-Learning

Machine Learning, integrated with Information Systems helps people make decisions in various areas like medical diagnosis, loan-granting, and areas which may have ethical and legal implications. Here, I am trying to implement Machine learning for decision making in areas like Housing, Crime Recidivism using Python. Also, I have tried using various regression techniques and Themis- ML techniques for my final project.
